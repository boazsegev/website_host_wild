# The Price of Bread and Honey

My pricing scheme is designed to follow common industry practices and minimize your overhead expenses when possible.

The following price details are a good representation of what I would expect you to offer.

* *Songwriting*:

    Once we sit in the room and start songwriting, I expect to receive an equal share as a songwriter (which is also the law when a split-sheet doesn't state otherwise).

    However, song critique and any minor suggestions that result from the song critique are free as part of my production services.

* *Demo Production*:

    Production prices in the industry vary and are often a mix between up-front payments and co-ownership of the master and recordings.

    Often, when I believe in a song, I'll be willing to produce the *Demo* without any up-front payments (except external expenses). However, I will expect 1% "record one" royalties from the released version (SLRP) in exchange for fronting my personal work and expenses.

    Other possible fee arrangements can be reached, including a flat fee for projects based on virtual instruments and a single vocal.

    *External expenses** include session players, external studio time (not my home studio) and the like. These do not include my own time, equipment, licensing fees etc'.

* *Master Production*:

    In addition to the details mentioned above, please notice that the production of a final master might require an external recording studio, session players, backing vocalists and the like.

    This also requires more work on my part.

    These details will be reflected in the price and the final cost (you will have to pay for any external expenses, just like demo productions).

    Prices start at a $1,500 advance and 3% "record one" royalties. When record labels are involved, we might agree that royalty payments would be due only after the label's expenses have been recouped.

* *Sync / Scoring*:

    There's a big difference between writing and producing a jingle and scoring a dramatic piece with a live orchestra (or a digital mockup).

    Prices start at $250 per minute (or part of a minute) and depend on specific details such as the requested style(s), instrumentation, delivery requirements, etc' - i.e., do you need a printed score? a mockup? do you expect a fully produced mix? is it an instrumental piece or a song?

    This does *not* include

I'm aware that much like music itself, there aren't any "one size fits all" solutions here and our actual agreement might look different.

Of course, until we reach an actual agreement that we're both happy with, you will not be able to use any work I may have completed.
