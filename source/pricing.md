# The Price of Bread and Honey

Being a musician isn't cheap, I know. It seems like everything costs money. Our instruments, maintenance (I play Piano, so I'll add tuning to these costs), constantly putting in time and effort into our practice and the improvement of our art and skills.

As a producer, I'm even more aware of these high costs, audio interfaces, microphones, pre-amps, plug-ins, software licenses, VSTs...

I don't want you to feel that I'm reaching for your pocket.
