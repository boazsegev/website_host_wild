# The Price of Bread and Honey

My pricing scheme is designed to follow common industry practices and minimize your overhead expenses when possible.

I'm aware that much like music itself, there aren't any "one size fits all" solutions here and our actual agreement might look different.

Of course, until we reach an actual agreement that we're both happy with, you will not be able to use any work I may have completed.

To all my USA clients, my current visa status (I'm in the USA with a student visa and without a green card) means that I won't be accepting any work in the USA.

The following price details are a good representation of what I would expect you to offer (for work outside the USA).

* *Songwriting*:

    Once we sit in the room and start songwriting, I expect to receive an equal share as a songwriter (which is also the law when a split-sheet doesn't state otherwise).

    However, song critique and any minor suggestions that result from the song critique are free as part of my production services.


* *Production*

    Production prices in the industry vary and are often a mix between up-front payments and co-ownership of the master and recordings.

    I split the production pricing into two models.

    The *Demo* model is designed for budding artists that need something for their artist portfolio to help them promote themselves and the song.

    The *Master* model is designed for more established artists that wish to release a song, an EP or an album.

    * *Master Production*:

        Prices start at a $1,500 advance and 3% co-ownership of the master (payed as "record one" royalties). When record labels are involved, we might agree that royalty payments would be due only after the label's expenses have been recouped, so you, as the artist, don't suffer out-of-pocket expenses.

        Production of a final master might require an external recording studio (not my home studio), session players, backing vocalists and the like. These external expenses aren't included in the price you will need to pay for them.

    * *Demo Production*:

        Producing a demo is similar to producing the actual song, only often the mixing process and the complexity of the song will be simpler.

        Often, when I believe in a song, I'll be willing to produce the *Demo* without any up-front payments (except external expenses). However, I will expect 1% "record one" royalties (SLRP) from the released version in exchange for fronting my personal work and expenses.

        Other possible fee arrangements can be reached, including a flat fee for projects based on a small number of virtual instruments, a single vocal and a single live instrument (a Piano or a Guitar).

        *Notice*: a Demo can't be publicly released and I retain all ownership of the mechanical rights. Demos can only be used as part of an artist portfolio (not resale). For example, you can use them to promote either yourself or your song to record labels and as a draft for the final production. These limitations are mutual (I won't use the Demo except as part of my artist portfolio, same as you).

    *External expenses** include session players, external studio time (not my home studio) and the like. These do not include my own time, equipment, licensing fees etc'.

* *Sync / Scoring*:

    There's a big difference between writing and producing a jingle and scoring a dramatic piece with a live orchestra (or a digital mockup).

    Prices start at $250 per minute (or part of a minute) and depend on specific details such as the requested style(s), instrumentation, delivery requirements, etc' - i.e., do you need a printed score? a mockup? do you expect a fully produced mix? is it an instrumental piece or a song?

    These fees are licensing fees and the do *not* include copyright buyout fees. Unless buyout fees are agreed upon, I retain any and all copyrights.
