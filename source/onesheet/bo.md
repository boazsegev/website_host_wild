# Bo Wild - When a Student turns 40
![banner3:Bo Wild](/images/can_you_hear_me.jpg)

Now a Singer/Songwriter and producer, I was a scuba diving instructor, a lawyer, a tantric, a soldier and a Buddhist. I traveled all the continents except the warmest (Africa) and the coldest (Antarctica)... Music is my home.

Through it all there was one thing I learned - when we follow our inner voice, when we listen closely to the whispering of our hearts, we increase our capacity for compassion, happiness and a meaningful life.

Iâ€™m happy to share my music with you and hope my music and experiences give you insight into your own journey.

## My Music
