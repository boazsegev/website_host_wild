# Bo Wild - When a Student turns 40
![banner3:Bo Wild](/images/can_you_hear_me.jpg)

I believe the best songs are the ones that **express our true inner voice in the most authentic way.**

Now a Singer/Songwriter and producer, I was a scuba diving instructor, a lawyer, a tantric, a soldier, a Buddhist and more things than I care to remember...

I traveled all the continents except the warmest (Africa) and the coldest (Antarctica).

This is what I learned:

#### **when we follow our inner voice, when we listen closely to the whispering of our hearts, we increase our capacity for compassion, happiness and a meaningful life**.

Iâ€™m happy to share my music with you. I hope my music and experiences give you insight into your own journey.

## Sample Songs

Here are a few private links in case you wonder about what I've been working on.

Thank you for listening to my vocals. I'm no vocalist by any stretch, but I chose to attempt the vocal lines so I could better understand the vocalist's perspective.

**Originals** (100% me: written, played, sung and mixed):

*  [It's Me (original, production demo)](/media/its_me.m4a "play: It's Me")
*  [Turned Gray (original, mock-up demo)](/media/turned_gray.m4a "play: Turned Gray")
*  [Lost Soul (original, studio band)](/media/lost_soul.m4a "play: Lost Soul")\*

<div style='font-size:0.8em'>* Recorded with Hinako Sato (Piano), Yoshihi Yamada (Bass) and Renato Milone (Drums).</div>

**Co-Writes**:

[Alida McKeon](https://www.facebook.com/alida.mckeon) is a wonderful singer/songwriter enamored with the Jazzy style of the American Songbook.

In our co-writing session I couldn't help but connect to her love for the style and an AABA standard style song was born.

*  [The Note You Left (original, piano-vocal from the room)](/media/the_note_you_left.m4a "play: The Note You Left")

**Piano Demos**:

I usually don't show my earlier sketches, but this one is a little special to me:

*  [Silver Dreams (original, piano demo)](/media/silver_dreams.m4a "play: Silver Dreams")

**Covers** (100% me: arranged, composed and mixed):

*  [While My Guitar Gently Weeps (cover, production)](/media/whilemyguitar.m4a "play: While My Guitar Gently Weeps")\*

<div style='font-size:0.8em'>* Written by George Harrison (The Beatles), vocals by <a href='https://www.facebook.com/ami.michalp'>Ami Pienknagura</a>.</div>

## Sample Commercial Scores

The following links are to commercial scores that I composed and produced during my studies at Berklee (class assignments)

They all sound different, showcasing my approach to discovering the inner voice of the artists I work with (in this case, the inner voice behind the products).

## Contact:

I'm available at [bo@bowild.com](mailto:bo@bowild.com) and [(617) 642-5815](tel:6176425815)

I do my best to respond promptly to emails, texts and phone calls.

If I'm in the studio or otherwise engaged, I will do my best to get back to you as soon as the session is over.

Please note I might be abroad during May and June and allow for a response time of up to a two days.

## CV (Curriculum Vitae)

I know you asked for one, but it's quite hard to cover more than 20 years of wondering. Besides, none of the official information is music related since music was a hobby until I decided to liquidate my law firm and leave the country of my ancestors (Israel).

My longest stretch at a single profession was a 10 year haul as a Lawyer. Between 2004 and 2014 I worked as a paralegal, an intern, a lawyer and eventually a managing partner at a litigation firm in Tel Aviv... although I worked a number of jobs during that time as well as spent a number of months in China and Thailand to study Yoga and eastern meditation techniques.

I used to code for a while (mostly in C, Ruby and JavaScript). I only mention this because it's something I did on and off for a long time. I am still [active in the community](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4025095/myst) and I still [manage a number of open source projects](https://github.com/boazsegev).

I had other professions, some more honorable than others, but I was rarely employed. I was almost always a freelancer.

I spent 1996-1998 in the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) and spent the year after re-learning to walk due to a spinal injury. Fun times... but I left with a solid understanding of the energetic body and spiritual healing practices (I refused to have an army doctor cut me open and mess with my spine).

I always thought that once I made enough money (which, as my parents explained, wasn't something artists do), I will retire and devote my life to music and arts.

I guess I got here earlier than anyone thought... yet I bemoan my lost years. Money is a beautiful facilitator, but it isn't a goal onto itself.
