# The Sprout Recital

## Oct. 19th, 2017, 4pm EST

<div style='text-align:left; padding:0 0 0 10%;' data-play:"go">
Before the tall oaks could kiss the clouds,<BR />
Before their roots ever entered the earth's womb,<BR />
They were all just little sprouts,<BR />
Shorter than a flower's bloom.

Every musician has an origin story, the first time they took a step into the spotlights of center stage and played their hearts to the world.

This October, my origin story begins.

I will step into the [spotlight](/media/lost_soul.m4a "play: Lost Soul") to share with you original songs of my life untold and it's buried secrets.

### With a little help from...

Oaks need the softness of sunlight and the kindness of rain before they sprout. Me? I need my friends.

On stage with me are:

* The Amazing [Leanne Mosher](https://lmoser12.wixsite.com/leannemoser/music) - vocals, guitar and joy.
* The Great Weijun Yang - guitar and soul.
* The Brilliant Gie Trax - bass and heart.
* The Distinguished Taiki Miyazawa - drums and kindness.
 
Off stage, wonderful and kind, are my friends, rooting for me from the crowd and behind computer screens across the globe. You will recognize them by their shine, they are all bright souls.

With sepcial thanks to The Berklee College Of Music.

## And Me

My name is Boaz Segev, which is a jaw breaker of a name, so people call me Bo.

I'm as wild as a summer breeze from the winter ocean - uncoltivated and kind.
