# The Sprout Recital - Players Page

## Hi, Amazing players!

I'll update this page with the show's Set (playlist) and add links to rehearsal demos and lead sheets.

Since most of the songs are fairly simple, I hope you would have them memorized. I think reading the lead sheets during a show is distracting.

Please feel free to make suggestions and improvements.

## The Set / Playlist

The main links lead to my Evernote notes about each song, which is where you can find the updated Lyrics as well as Sibelius files, older drafts etc'. The demo and score links link to a demo and a score (where available).

1. [Hello (Please Don't Say Goodbye)](https://www.evernote.com/l/AMdckF7s04BCR5HT-wpKlVqQXbURhvRPoTs): [play demo](media/hello.m4a "score: Hello (Please Don't Say Goodbye)") - I'd love help with parts.
