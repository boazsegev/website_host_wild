## Songs

The following are some rough demos for songs I enjoyed writing.

I hope you enjoy listening to these songs as much as I enjoyed writing them.

##### Hunger and Need

Some stories are hard to talk about, but, somehow, they leak into my music and come out in song.

This song is dedicated to all the people out there who want to overcome their own misfortune through their own effort, and to the people watching from the sideline wishing they could help.

[**Hunger and Need (a Smile at a Time)** / Me](/media/hunger_and_need.m4a "score: Hunger and Need")

> **V.1**
> 
> She cooks for me with flames of passion,
> 
> She knows just what I need to taste,
> 
> Truth is hard to swallow,
> 
> I taste the price of our disgrace.
> 
> **V.2**
> 
> To save our hearts I sell for dollars
> 
> My slice of life per day and night
> 
> Even god can't save me
> 
> If other men can steal her light
> 
> **Pre.**
> 
> From the shadows I watch her dance, 
> 
> She’s not dancing for me
> 
> **Ch.**
> 
> Selling our souls, a smile at a time
> 
> She suffers it all, a smile at a time
> 
> I'm losing my mind, a smile at a time
> 
> A slave to my hunger and need
> 
> **V.3**
> 
> With every breathe she's loosing thunder
> 
> Her laughing eyes are turning gray
> 
> I'm losing all I ever wanted
> 
> I cry as she slips away
> 
> **Pre.**
> 
> From the shadows I watch her dance, 
> 
> She’s not dancing for me
> 
> **Ch.**
> 
> Selling our souls, a smile at a time

> She suffers it all, a smile at a time
> 
> I'm losing my mind, a smile at a time
> 
> A slave to my hunger and need
> 
> **Br.**
> 
> I blame the skies and curse the heavens,
> 
> Their judgment cruel with righteous pride 
> 
> They judge the way she sold her body,
> 
> But I’m the one who can’t provide
> 
> Yes, I’m the one who can’t provide
> 
> **Ch.**
> 
> Selling our souls, a smile at a time
> 
> She suffers it all, a smile at a time
> 
> I'm losing my mind, a smile at a time
> 
> A slave to my hunger
> 
> It's taking it's toll, a smile at a time
> 
> A dollar and pole, a smile at a time
> 
> She's breaking my heart, a smile at a time
> 
> A slave to my hunger and need
> 
> A slave to my hunger and need
> 

##### It's Me

For years I was in love with a girl who couldn't care enough to acknowledge my existence. I was 6 years old when she stole my heart and more than 13 years old before I reclaimed it.

I think we all go through that at some point in our lives. I just had to do it more than once... High school was much the same with a different girl and my adult life took a while to improve.

I was luck enough to analyze the works of the Beatles and their amazing songwriting skills with Prof. Suzanne Clark.

During our work, I wrote this song inspired by my own story and some of the techniques employed by John Lennon and Sir Paul McCartney.

[**It's Me** / Me](/media/its_me.m4a "score: It's Me")

> **V.1.**
> 
> I guess it’s true,
> 
> what they all said,
> 
> He wasn’t true, he made you sad
> 
> But don’t you know there’s someone
> 
> that you can always count on
> 
> Oh don’t you know? It's me. 

> **V.2.**
> 
> So many years I loved you, but I never said
> 
> These hopes and fears inside me, and all the tears I shed
> 
> Oh, all this time together
> 
> And still you don’t know better
> 
> How don’t you know? It's me. It's ...

> **Br.**
> 
> Me that hears your cries, in the silence of the night
> 
> I share your sighs, your lows, your highs
> 
> and you should know,
> 
> I loved you, since I met you, on that night in New Years Eve,
> 
> This love will never fade or leave

> **Br.2.**
> 
> This love, this love, this love, this love
> 
> This love will never die

> **V.3.**
> 
> The day will come and you will see,
> 
> That this old heart is all you need
> 
> One day we'll be together
> 
> And things will just get better
> 
> The day you'll know, it's me. 

##### Turned Gray

I love animation movies, like Finding Nemo and Toy Story. I don't know what it is, but somehow the adult in me is torn be these little stories.

And the opening of the film Up was one I couldn't easily let go of... and this is how this song was born.

[**Turned Gray** / Me](/media/turned_gray.m4a "score: Turned Gray")

> **V.1.**
> 
> Small broken dreams, we left by the stream,
> 
> With our childhood and younger days
> 
> Promises made, were stolen away,
> 
> Time flowing on it’s way
> 
> By time twisting years that stray.
> 
> Sitting right here, as days turn to years,
> 
> I wonder you never say,
> 
> That all the dreams we promised, turned gray

> **V.2.**
> 
> Holding our hands, through decades that bend
> 
> I still have so much to say
> 
> Our old childhood dreams, are torn at the seams
> 
> I doubt if we'll see them one day
> 
> Worn kitchen chairs, slumped wooden stairs,
> 
> Consumed by an old routine.

> **Br.**
> 
> On slow afternoons at home (Home with you)
> 
> Curled by the TV screen (You’re in my arms)
> 
> It's better than any dream or adventure I'd known,
> 
> Oh...

> **V.3.**
> 
> Christmas tree lights, still shining bright,
> 
> We bought them so long ago
> 
> You gift me this book, of peter and hook
> 
> Wrapped in your love and a bow
> 
> Though we grow old, walking this road
> 
> Please know that for me it's okay
> 
> That all the dreams we promised, turned gray

##### Lost Soul

[Lost Soul](/media/lost_soul.m4a "score: Lost Soul") is one I am quietly in love with. There's a million songs about "_boy meets girl at bar and never sees here again_", but this story is my story, which makes it a bit more personal... at least for me.

[**Lost Soul** / Me](/media/lost_soul.m4a "score: Lost Soul")

> **V.1.**
> 
> She stood in the spotlight, with an old stained guitar
> 
> Teasing a song
> 
> as I watched from the bar
> 
> She was clouds on the horizon,
> 
> Trouble on the breeze
> 
> And she had me
> 
> on my knees


> **Ch.**
> 
> She was a lost soul
> 
> Shouldn’t give my heart
> 
> Knew it from the start
> 
> She was a lost soul 
> 
> Lost soul
> 
> Lost Soul


> **V.2.**
> 
> Her shattered breath
> 
> Went under my guard
> 
> With her soft voice
> 
> She hit me quite hard
> 
> She was the cry of thunder drums
> 
> Lightning on high seas
> 
> And she had me
> 
> on my knees


> **Ch.**
> 
> She was a lost soul...


> **Br.**
> 
> I had this need to save her,
> 
> Saving her just might save me,
> 
> But I heard it in that moment,
> 
> in her graceful movement,
> 
> I knew that it could never be


> **Ch.**
> 
> She was a lost soul...

 
> **V.3.**
> 
> She broke my heart
> 
> And left me that night
> 
> It's been a while 
> 
> But I still crave her light
> 
> She was summer dream in winter
> 
> A kiss of fire as I freeze
> 
> And she had me
> 
> on my knees


> **Ch.**
> 
> She was a lost soul...

##### Morning Sunshine

Some songs I never got to record properly... but when I have some free time, I would love to take them back in to the studio and make a proper demo.

Morning Sunshine is definitely one of the songs I want to record.

It's sweet and honest and I wrote it during one of those magical moods when I was beginning to fall in love, just before loosing my balance and crashing.

Anyway, I even [have a score](/media/morning_sunshine.pdf), ready for when I can record it.

[**Morning Sunshine** / Me](/media/morning_sunshine.pdf)

> **V.1**
> 
> Sunday morning,
> 
> we’re still in bed
> 
> I hear her mumble
> 
> Her curls all tumble on my chest

> If I'm dreaming? (is he dreaming?)
> 
> If she’s not here
> 
> Oh morning sunshine, (morning sun_shine)
> 
> please disappear

> **V.2**
> 
> If she wakes up
> 
> Oh, if she leaves
> 
> I’ll be lonely (so lonely___)
> 
> Oh, I would plainly lose my mind

 
> Now she’s sleeping,
> 
> So don’t come near,
> 
> Oh morning sunshine, (oh ooo___)
> 
> please disappear (disappear)

> **Br.**
> 
> Before I met her
> 
> My nights were always blue
> 
> Empty evenings,
> 
> Each time with someone new


> The day I met her
> 
> She stole away my heart
> 
> I damn the daytime
> 
> That's keeping us apart

> **V.3**
> 
> Monday morning,
> 
> I’m off to work
> 
> She said she’ll meet me (oh yeah)
> 
> I’ll pick her up right after dark


> I can’t wait, no
> 
> To see my dear (at night together)
> 
> Oh morning sunshine,
> 
> please disappear


## Sync

I had fun scoring these commercials and I hope you enjoy the score.

The iPad commercial is probably my favorite, since I felt it was am improvement on the original score - check it out and let me know what you think.

##### iPad

I love drums and rhythm... there's something raw and powerful.

And this commercial just screamed to me "big bang", where music emerges from chaos.

<div style="text-align: center"><iframe width="560" height="316" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fe_fmv08qNs?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen style='display: inline-block; margin: 0.4em;'></iframe></div>

<p> </p>

##### Rebook

I found this commercial a bit of a challenge. I wanted the sounds to be organic, but fresh and young, like running shoes - they are a technology that let's us go running in nature.

Eventually I think I managed to find a balance between the digital and nature, using both orchestral and synth sounds. An interesting mix.

<div style="text-align: center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MKI2EKgV8n0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen style='display: inline-block; margin: 0.4em;'></iframe></div>

<p> </p>

##### Purina

Purina is a household name for dog food... but I fell in love with their concept the moment I got to see the commercial.

Even without sound, the sweetness of heroic dreams and the innocence of youth were oozing from the concept. Now I just had to figure out how to draw these qualities out and make them shine.

I decided on a balance between a bit of humor and a touch of drama to bring the heroic and playful puppy dreams to life, which brought me up to orchestral sounds and a sprinkle of corny voicings in fourths.

<div style="text-align: center"><iframe width="560" height="316" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2CA8BR_boqo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen style='display: inline-block; margin: 0.4em;'></iframe></div>

<p> </p>

##### Cheetos

I really love detective films. Something about the film-noir calls to me... but I'm a real sucker for spy films with Jazzy big band scores. I just can't get enough of them.

So when I saw this old Cheetos commercial, I has to give a shot at scoring it.

Sadly, this one has no sound design. I was focused on learning the Jazzy sound and wasn't too concerned about the polish.

<div style="text-align: center"><iframe width="560" height="316" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sa4cFCnTn2c?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen style='display: inline-block; margin: 0.4em;'></iframe></div>

<p> </p>

##### Japp

This hilarious commercial was re-scored as a school assignment. I ended up writing a song which I really enjoyed and I hope you enjoy it as well.

After the first time, feel free to follow along with [the score](/media/together.pdf) if you like.

##### West 40

I was asked by a friend for a 40 second musical piece that matched the famous mood and feel in [the theme for Westworld](https://youtu.be/rYelEUVQ50g).

[West 40](/media/west40.m4a "play: West 40") was written as a simplified mood version that leaves more room for the video than the theme that inspired it.

Now, Westworld's theme is beautiful and smart. Ramin Djawadi wrote a wonderful piece. It's multi-layered and moving and full of story. I wondered - how could I compress that into 40 seconds?

Moreover, the piece of music was for a class and they would edit to my music (instead of the other way around), which meant I didn't have any picture to start with. Also, I didn't have enough time to find a Dobro for that beautiful metallic sound.

I must say, it was a fun challenge and I hope you enjoy it too.

## Instrumental

##### The Warlord's Lament

Warlords don't really expect to age, they don't often reflect on their life's accomplishments and they rarely live long enough to get the chance.

Allow us to listen to the Strings as they follow an aging warlord's musing in [The Warlord's Lament](/media/the%20warlords%20lament.m4a "score: The Warlord's Lament"). Let us march along the footsteps of empty victories and lost friends.

##### Big Band Mood Piece

I really enjoyed writing [iSpy Bo](/media/ispy_bo.mp3 "score: iSpy Bo").

Sadly I couldn't record this piece as well as I had hoped, but I really enjoyed working with the ensemble and discovering more ways to write instrumental pieces.
