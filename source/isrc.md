# ISRC - International Standard Recording Code

After mastering songs, a master is assigned a unique ISRC that helps track it's ownership and use.

When I assign a unique ISRC to a master, it will begin with the code QZ-AYA.

Each master will be assigned a unique code and any changes to the master (re-mastering, re-mixing, fades longer than 10 sec. etc') will result in a new ISRC code being assigned.

On this page you can find the ISRC codes I publicly assigned and their current copyright holder.

## QZ-AYA-17-XXXXX
