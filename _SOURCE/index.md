# Music can Change the World

### Music can set us free

![banner3:Bo Wild](/images/can_you_hear_me.jpg)

Music is the language of our souls.

The stories we share through music speak to the heart, they bring people together and fill us with compassion, happiness and joy.

I believe we can increase our capacity for joy and compassion through music.

Iâ€™m excited to share my music with you.
