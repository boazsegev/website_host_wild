# I Believe Music can Change the World

### I Believe Music Can Set Us Free

![banner3:Bo Wild](/images/can_you_hear_me.jpg)

I spent my life trying out different professions, different countries, different identities... an ex-soldier, a Buddhist, a lawyer, a tantric - but **all roads lead inwards**, into the person we truly are.

So I became a **musician**.

I believe **we all have our own unique voice**, that we have an inner truth that we yearn to express and it is unique to who we are.

Music speaks to me, to all of us. The stories we share through music **speak to the heart**, they bring us together and they move us in **wonderful and mysterious ways**.

As a [Producer](producer), [Composer](composer) and [Songwriter](songwriter), I am **honored** to help you share your story and express your truth through music.

As an [Artist](artist), I strive to do the same.
