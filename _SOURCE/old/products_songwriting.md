# Songwriting

I was lucky and privileged enough to spend a few years learning with amazing teachers and songwriting masters such as Pat Pattison, Susan Cattaneo, Ben Camp, Scarlet Keys and many more that I hold dear and close to my heart.

I am thrilled to be the humble vessel through which their knowledge and tools can be shared during our time together. These amazing ideas and tools offer a wonderful opportunity to improve your lyrics and melody and to help the telling of your story.

I will never force my opinions - after all, I'm here to serve your vision. However, I am very happy to share these tools with you.
