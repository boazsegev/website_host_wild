# Singing Your Story to Inspire

Hi, my name is Bo, and I am here to help you sing **Your** story.

I will guide your story from idea to product, helping with:

* **Songwriting**.

* **Producing** a demo, a single, an EP or a full album.

* **Mixing/Mastering** if you're working with a different producer, I can cleanup the mix or master the track.

    I do recommend, if budget allows, to always have a third party (not the producer / mixing engineer) finish up the mastering. Having a fresh set of ears adds a lot to the mastering stage.

I'm honored and thankful that you chose to visit my website and that you would share your story with me.
