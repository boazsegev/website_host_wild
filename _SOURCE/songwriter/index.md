## Honoring Your Truth

![banner3:Bo Wild](/images/white_piano.jpg#banner3)

I believe we all have our own unique voice, that we have an inner truth that we yearn to express and it is unique to who we are.

Songs I wrote for myself can be heard on [![logo:Apple Music](/images/apple_music.svg)](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bo-wild/1602428458) [![logo:Spotify](/images/spotify.svg)](https://open.spotify.com/artist/06LFekW9oLivQ96QMf2RcH) [![logo:YouTube Music](/images/youtube_music.svg)](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mk6iRCKmpjBGdbjl3oaRKNTM7iFuLbxNo) [![logo:Yandex Music](/images/yandex_music.svg)](https://music.yandex.com/artist/15535336)

## Focusing Your Expression

There is something very intimate about writing a song.

I was lucky and privileged enough to spend a few years learning with amazing teachers and songwriting masters such as Pat Pattison, Susan Cattaneo, Ben Camp, Scarlet Keys and many more that I hold dear and close to my heart.

I am thrilled to be the humble vessel through which their knowledge and tools can be shared during our time together.

These amazing ideas and tools offer a wonderful opportunity to focus your lyrics and melody and to help the telling of your story.

I will never force my opinions - after all, **I'm here to serve your vision**. However, I am very happy to share these tools with you.

## Songs

The following are some rough demos for songs I enjoyed writing.

I hope you enjoy listening to these songs as much as I enjoyed writing them.

##### Hunger and Need

Some stories are hard to talk about, but, somehow, they leak into my music and come out in song.

This song is dedicated to all the people out there who want to overcome their own misfortune through their own effort, and to the people watching from the sideline wishing they could help.

[**Hunger and Need (a Smile at a Time)** / Me](/media/hunger_and_need.m4a "score: Hunger and Need")

Lyrics, Composition, Production and Performance: Bo Wild

> **V.1**
> 
> She cooks for me with flames of passion,
> 
> She knows just what I need to taste,
> 
> Truth is hard to swallow,
> 
> I taste the price of our disgrace.

> **V.2**
> 
> To save our hearts I sell for dollars
> 
> My slice of life per day and night
> 
> Even god can't save me
> 
> If other men can steal her light

> **Pre.**
> 
> From the shadows I watch her dance, 
> 
> She’s not dancing for me

> **Ch.**
> 
> Selling our souls, a smile at a time
> 
> She suffers it all, a smile at a time
> 
> I'm losing my mind, a smile at a time
> 
> A slave to my hunger and need

> **V.3**
> 
> With every breathe she's loosing thunder
> 
> Her laughing eyes are turning gray
> 
> I'm losing all I ever wanted
> 
> I cry as she slips away

> **Pre.**
> 
> From the shadows I watch her dance, 
> 
> She’s not dancing for me

> **Ch.**
> 
> Selling our souls, a smile at a time
> 
> She suffers it all, a smile at a time
> 
> I'm losing my mind, a smile at a time
> 
> A slave to my hunger and need

> **Br.**
> 
> I blame the skies and curse the heavens,
> 
> Their judgment cruel with righteous pride 
> 
> They judge the way she sold her body,
> 
> But I’m the one who can’t provide
> 
> Yes, I’m the one who can’t provide

> **Ch.**
> 
> Selling our souls, a smile at a time
> 
> She suffers it all, a smile at a time
> 
> I'm losing my mind, a smile at a time
> 
> A slave to my hunger
> 
> It's taking it's toll, a smile at a time
> 
> A dollar and pole, a smile at a time
> 
> She's breaking my heart, a smile at a time
> 
> A slave to my hunger and need
> 
> A slave to my hunger and need
> 

##### More Than I Can Say (Words I Learned)

Some emotions don't fit inside the words we learned to say.

[**More Than I Can Say** / Me](/media/more_than_i_can_say.m4a "play: More Than I Can Say")

Lyrics, Composition, Production and Performance: Bo Wild

> **V.1**
>
> Girl tonight I'll take you by the hand and make you shine
>
> Dancing in the park with summer stars
>
> Sitting on a wooden bench and swimming in your eyes
>
> Watching while the world just strolls on by

> **Ch.**
>
> Don't you know I love you more than I could say, love
>
> Words I learned refuse to say enough.
>
> Don't you know I love you more than I could say
>
> Let me whisper with my touch

> **V.2**
>
> Move a little closer I don't want to say goodbye
>
> Let me heal my scars in your embrace
>
> Let me taste your kindness with my hands around your waist
>
> Can't you feel us falling in to grace?

> **Ch.**
>
> Don't you know I love you more than I could say, love
>
> Words I learned refuse to say enough.
>
> Don't you know I love you more than I could say
>
> Let me whisper with my touch

> **Br.**
>
> I never thought you'd love me
>
> You're more than I deserve.

> **Ch.**
>
> Don't you know I love you more than I could say, love
>
> Words I learned refuse to say enough.
>
> Don't you know I love you more than I could say
>
> Let me whisper with my touch
>
> I love you

##### It's Me

For years I was in love with a girl who couldn't care enough to acknowledge my existence. I was 6 years old when she stole my heart and more than 13 years old before I reclaimed it.

I think we all go through that at some point in our lives. I just had to do it more than once... High school was much the same with a different girl and my adult life took a while to improve.

I was luck enough to analyze the works of the Beatles and their amazing songwriting skills with Prof. Suzanne Clark.

During our work, I wrote this song inspired by my own story and some of the techniques employed by John Lennon and Sir Paul McCartney.

[**It's Me** / Me](/media/its_me.m4a "score: It's Me")

Lyrics, Composition, Production and Performance: Bo Wild

> **V.1.**
> 
> I guess it’s true,
> 
> what they all said,
> 
> He wasn’t true, he made you sad
> 
> But don’t you know there’s someone
> 
> that you can always count on
> 
> Oh don’t you know? It's me. 

> **V.2.**
> 
> So many years I loved you, but I never said
> 
> These hopes and fears inside me, and all the tears I shed
> 
> Oh, all this time together
> 
> And still you don’t know better
> 
> How don’t you know? It's me. It's ...

> **Br.**
> 
> Me that hears your cries, in the silence of the night
> 
> I share your sighs, your lows, your highs
> 
> and you should know,
> 
> I loved you, since I met you, on that night in New Years Eve,
> 
> This love will never fade or leave

> **Br.2.**
> 
> This love, this love, this love, this love
> 
> This love will never die

> **V.3.**
> 
> The day will come and you will see,
> 
> That this old heart is all you need
> 
> One day we'll be together
> 
> And things will just get better
> 
> The day you'll know, it's me. 

##### I Close my Eyes (broken on the floor)

It so hard for me to give up on relationships.

I know, in my __head__, that sometimes it just doesn't fit... but in my __heart__, it's so hard to let go.

[**I Close my Eyes (broken on the floor)** / Me (demo)](/media/i_close_my_eyes_demo.m4a "play: I Close My Eyes")

> **V.1**
>
> Sweet, sweat on cotton sheets
>
> I lost my heart in winter storms
>
> Outside snow, inside we felt the heat
>
> Now it's broken on the floor

> **V.2**
>
> Scrambled eggs and little lies
>
> Monday mornings in the spring
>
> Stolen flowers you kissed along the way
>
> Left us broken on the floor
>
> Broken on the floor

> **Ch.**
>
> I close my eyes
>
> Don't wanna see no lies
>
> They keep me here, still holding on
>
> I close my eyes
>
> (and) Watch as our love dies
>
> I know it's time to let it go
>
> Should let it go

> **V.3**
>
> Desperate heat through summer nights
>
> On repeat we'd kiss and fight
>
> I should have gone but hope still held me tight
>
> Now it's broken on the floor
>
> Broken on the floor

> **Ch.**
>
> I close my eyes
>
> Don't wanna see no lies
>
> They keep me here, still holding on
>
> I close my eyes
>
> (and) Watch as our love dies
>

>
> Should let it go

> **Ch.Alt.**
>
> I close my eyes
>
> Cut away these ties
>
> Admit what our heart already know
>
> I close my eyes
>
> (and) Whisper my goodbyes
>
> I’m brave enough to let it go
>
> I let it go

##### Don't Fly

Inspired by the amazing, soul shattering, and highly recommended book ["All the Bright Places" by Jennifer Niven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_Bright_Places).

[**Don't Fly** / Me](/media/dont_fly.m4a "play: Don't Fly")

Lyrics, Composition, Production and Performance: Bo Wild

> **V.1**
>
> Standing on this roof top, arms that spread like wings
>
> Fighting this desire to take that final flight
>
> I beg for her to hear me over the sound of all our fears

> **Pre.1**
>
> I sing away the darkness
>
> Try to hold the sky
>
> The world is too big
>
> She holds me as she cries 

> **Ch**
>
> Please, don't fly
>
> Please, don't fly
>
> Please, don't fly
>
> Don't fly
>
> Don't

> **V.2**
>
> There 're days when we are golden, rainbow footsteps where we run
>
> There 're days when we are fearless, lifting fists against the sun
>
> But now the smiles are failing, there's a wall behind these eyes.

> **Pre.2**
>
> I sing away the darkness
>
> Try to hold the sky
>
> Never show my weakness
>
> And struggle as she cries     

> **Ch**
>
> Please, don't fly
>
> Please, don't fly
>
> Please, don't fly
>
> Don't fly
>
> Don’t

> **Br.1**
>
> God, I don't know what I'm doing.
>
> This pain is written in my bones.
>
> I don't want my pain to touch her. 
>
> Can't she see I'm not that strong?
>
> As she whispers to hold on

> **V.3**
>
> I'm standing in this shadow, where pain and troubles hum and ring
>
> And my shadow's tilting falling, she wants to fight but she can't win
>
> I'm bending on this rooftop, my arms are golden wings

> **Br.2**
>
> I am different 
>
> I’m an outcast
>
> My only home is in her smile
>
> She’s my shelter 
>
> She’s my heart beat
>
> I hear it's rhythm, soft and wild
>
> Whispering

> **Ch**
>
> Please, don't fly
>
> Please, don't fly
>
> Please, don't fly
>
> Don't fly
>
> Don’t
>
> Please, don't fly
>
> Please, don't fly
>
> Please, don't fly
>
> Don't fly
>
> Don’t
>
> Fly

##### Turned Gray

I love animation movies, like Finding Nemo and Toy Story. I don't know what it is, but somehow the adult in me is torn be these little stories.

And the opening of the film Up was one I couldn't easily let go of... and this is how this song was born.

[**Turned Gray** / Me](/media/turned_gray.m4a "score: Turned Gray")

Lyrics, Composition, Production and Performance: Bo Wild

> **V.1.**
> 
> Small broken dreams, we left by the stream,
> 
> With our childhood and younger days
> 
> Promises made, were stolen away,
> 
> Time flowing on it’s way
> 
> By time twisting years that stray.
> 
> Sitting right here, as days turn to years,
> 
> I wonder you never say,
> 
> That all the dreams we promised, turned gray

> **V.2.**
> 
> Holding our hands, through decades that bend
> 
> I still have so much to say
> 
> Our old childhood dreams, are torn at the seams
> 
> I doubt if we'll see them one day
> 
> Worn kitchen chairs, slumped wooden stairs,
> 
> Consumed by an old routine.

> **Br.**
> 
> On slow afternoons at home (Home with you)
> 
> Curled by the TV screen (You’re in my arms)
> 
> It's better than any dream or adventure I'd known,
> 
> Oh...

> **V.3.**
> 
> Christmas tree lights, still shining bright,
> 
> We bought them so long ago
> 
> You gift me this book, of peter and hook
> 
> Wrapped in your love and a bow
> 
> Though we grow old, walking this road
> 
> Please know that for me it's okay
> 
> That all the dreams we promised, turned gray

##### Lost Soul

[Lost Soul](/media/lost_soul.m4a "score: Lost Soul") is one I am quietly in love with. There's a million songs about "_boy meets girl at bar and never sees here again_", but this story is my story, which makes it a bit more personal... at least for me.

[**Lost Soul** / Me](/media/lost_soul.m4a "score: Lost Soul")

**Piano**: [Hinako Sato](https://www.hinakosato.com)
**Bass**: Yoshihi Yamada
**Drums**: [Renato Milone](https://www.renatomilone.com)
Lyrics, Composition, Production and Performance: Bo Wild

> **V.1.**
> 
> She stood in the spotlight, with an old stained guitar
> 
> Teasing a song
> 
> as I watched from the bar
> 
> She was clouds on the horizon,
> 
> Trouble on the breeze
> 
> And she had me
> 
> on my knees

> **Ch.**
> 
> She was a lost soul
> 
> Shouldn’t give my heart
> 
> Knew it from the start
> 
> She was a lost soul 
> 
> Lost soul
> 
> Lost Soul

> **V.2.**
> 
> Her shattered breath
> 
> Went under my guard
> 
> With her soft voice
> 
> She hit me quite hard
> 
> She was the cry of thunder drums
> 
> Lightning on high seas
> 
> And she had me
> 
> on my knees

> **Ch.**
> 
> She was a lost soul...

> **Br.**
> 
> I had this need to save her,
> 
> Saving her just might save me,
> 
> But I heard it in that moment,
> 
> in her graceful movement,
> 
> I knew that it could never be

> **Ch.**
> 
> She was a lost soul...

> **V.3.**
> 
> She broke my heart
> 
> And left me that night
> 
> It's been a while 
> 
> But I still crave her light
> 
> She was summer dream in winter
> 
> A kiss of fire as I freeze
> 
> And she had me
> 
> on my knees

> **Ch.**
> 
> She was a lost soul...

##### Morning Sunshine

Some songs I never got to record properly... but when I have some free time, I would love to take them back in to the studio and make a proper demo.

Morning Sunshine is definitely one of the songs I want to record.

It's sweet and honest and I wrote it during one of those magical moods when I was beginning to fall in love, just before loosing my balance and crashing.

Anyway, I even [have a score](/media/morning_sunshine.pdf), ready for when I can record it.

[**Morning Sunshine** / Me](/media/morning_sunshine.pdf)

> **V.1**
> 
> Sunday morning,
> 
> we’re still in bed
> 
> I hear her mumble
> 
> Her curls all tumble on my chest

> If I'm dreaming? (is he dreaming?)
> 
> If she’s not here
> 
> Oh morning sunshine, (morning sun_shine)
> 
> please disappear

> **V.2**
> 
> If she wakes up
> 
> Oh, if she leaves
> 
> I’ll be lonely (so lonely___)
> 
> Oh, I would plainly lose my mind

 
> Now she’s sleeping,
> 
> So don’t come near,
> 
> Oh morning sunshine, (oh ooo___)
> 
> please disappear (disappear)

> **Br.**
> 
> Before I met her
> 
> My nights were always blue
> 
> Empty evenings,
> 
> Each time with someone new


> The day I met her
> 
> She stole away my heart
> 
> I damn the daytime
> 
> That's keeping us apart

> **V.3**
> 
> Monday morning,
> 
> I’m off to work
> 
> She said she’ll meet me (oh yeah)
> 
> I’ll pick her up right after dark


> I can’t wait, no
> 
> To see my dear (at night together)
> 
> Oh morning sunshine,
> 
> please disappear
