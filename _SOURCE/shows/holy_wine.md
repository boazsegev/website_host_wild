# Holy Wine / Bo Wild

## [March 28th, 2017, 7:00pm EST](holy_wine.ics)

<div style='text-align:left; padding:0 0 0 10%;' data-play:"go">
There was sweetness in your journey,<BR />
But there was sour sadness too.<BR />
For a moment rest your burden,<BR />
Though your journey isn't through.

I [invite you](holy_wine.ics) to a bitter sweet evening for slow reflection and slower songs.

There will be solo acoustic versions for [old favorits](/media/lost_soul2.m4a "play: Lost Soul") as well as some younger (newer) songs.

## Unplugged

On stage it will just be me. Open, exposed, with no one to hide behind, playing the acoustic piano or my steel string guitar.

I'm as Wild as a summer breeze on winter shores - uncultivated and kind.

My name is Boaz Segev, but you can call me Bo.

## With a little help from...
 
Off stage, wonderful and kind, you, my friends, rooting for me from the crowd and behind computer screens across the globe. You are the shining, bright souls that made this world the amazing place it is.

With special thanks to The Berklee College Of Music.

## Extra Credits

The teaser song you're listening to was recorded with Hinako Sato (Piano), Yoshihi Yamada (Bass) and Renato Milone (Drums).

The recital will start with a guest performance of the song "The Note You Left", performed by Alida McKeon with whom I co-wrote the song.

During the recital, I will probably perform the song "Anneanne", co-written with Deniz Demirkurt.

During the recital, I might also perform the song "Nightmare", co-written with Alec (William) Simpson.
