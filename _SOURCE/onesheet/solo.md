# Piano Stories - Bo Wild
![banner3:Bo Wild](/images/can_you_hear_me.jpg)

I believe music can change the world. Music can set us free.

Music is the language of our souls. The stories we share through music speak to the heart.

The stories we share through music bring people together and fill us with compassion, happiness and joy.

Iâ€™m excited to share my music with you.

## My Music

As a singer / songwriter my music focuses on stories. Influenced by The Beatles, the Blues, and American Country music, my style is easy to listen to and relaxed. Here are examples from songs I might sing:

*  [Hunger and Need (original)](/media/hunger_and_need.m4a "play: Hunger and Need")
*  [Silver Dreams (original, solo)](/media/silver_dreams.m4a "play: Silver Dreams")
*  [Don't Fly (original)](/media/dont_fly.m4a "play: Don't Fly")
*  [Lost Soul (original, band)](/media/lost_soul.m4a "play: Lost Soul")
