## Piano Stories

### Music is Love
![banner3_big:Bo Wild](/images/welcome_back.jpg#banner3_big)

As a singer / songwriter my music focuses on stories.

Influenced by The Beatles, the Blues, and American Country music, my style is easy to listen to and relaxed.

Here are examples from songs I might sing:

*  [Hunger and Need (original)](/media/hunger_and_need.m4a "play: Hunger and Need")
*  [Silver Dreams (original, solo)](/media/silver_dreams.m4a "play: Silver Dreams")
*  [Don't Fly (original)](/media/dont_fly.m4a "play: Don't Fly")
*  [Lost Soul (original, band)](/media/lost_soul.m4a "play: Lost Soul")
