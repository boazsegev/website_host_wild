## Piano Stories

### Music is Love
![banner3_big:Bo Wild](/images/welcome_back.jpg#banner3_big)

Now a Singer/Songwriter and producer, I was a scuba diving instructor, a lawyer, a tantric, a soldier and a Buddhist. I traveled all the continents except the warmest (Africa) and the coldest (Antarctica)... **Music is my home**.

Through it all there was one thing I learned - **when we follow our inner voice, when we listen closely to the whispering of our hearts, we increase our capacity for compassion, happiness and a meaningful life**.

I believe musical expression can bring our innermost truths to light.
