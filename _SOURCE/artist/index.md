## Piano Stories

### Music is Love
![banner3_big:Bo Wild](/images/welcome_back.jpg#banner3_big)

Now a Singer/Songwriter and producer, I was a scuba diving instructor, a lawyer, a tantric, a soldier and a Buddhist. I traveled all the continents except the warmest (Africa) and the coldest (Antarctica)... **Music is my home**.

Through it all there was one thing I learned - **when we follow our inner voice, when we listen closely to the whispering of our hearts, we increase our capacity for compassion, happiness and a meaningful life**.

I believe musical expression can bring our innermost truths to light.

Here are examples of my work:

*  [Hunger and Need (original)](/media/hunger_and_need.m4a "play: Hunger and Need")
*  [Silver Dreams (original, solo)](/media/silver_dreams.m4a "play: Silver Dreams")
*  [Don't Fly (original)](/media/dont_fly.m4a "play: Don't Fly")
*  [Lost Soul (original, band)](/media/lost_soul.m4a "play: Lost Soul")
