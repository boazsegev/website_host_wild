      <h1 id="the-price-of-bread-and-honey">The Price of Bread and Honey</h1>

<p>My pricing scheme is designed to follow common industry practices and minimize your overhead expenses when possible.</p>

<p>The following price details are a good representation of what I would expect you to offer.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Songwriting</em>:</p>

<p>Once we sit in the room and start songwriting, I expect to receive an equal share as a songwriter (which is also the law when a split-sheet doesn&#39;t state otherwise).</p>

<p>However, song critique and any minor suggestions that result from the song critique are free as part of my production services.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Demo Production</em>:</p>

<p>Production prices in the industry vary and are often a mix between up-front payments and co-ownership of the master and recordings.</p>

<p>Often, when I believe in a song, I&#39;ll be willing to produce the <em>Demo</em> without any up-front payments (except external expenses). However, I will expect 1% &quot;record one&quot; royalties from the released version (SLRP) in exchange for fronting my personal work and expenses.</p>

<p>Other possible fee arrangements can be reached, including a flat fee for projects based on virtual instruments and a single vocal.</p>

<p><em>External expenses</em>* include session players, external studio time (not my home studio) and the like. These do not include my own time, equipment, licensing fees etc&#39;.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Master Production</em>:</p>

<p>In addition to the details mentioned above, please notice that the production of a final master might require an external recording studio, session players, backing vocalists and the like.</p>

<p>This also requires more work on my part.</p>

<p>These details will be reflected in the price and the final cost (you will have to pay for any external expenses, just like demo productions).</p>

<p>Prices start at a $1,500 advance and 3% &quot;record one&quot; royalties. When record labels are involved, we might agree that royalty payments would be due only after the label&#39;s expenses have been recouped.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sync / Scoring</em>:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a big difference between writing and producing a jingle and scoring a dramatic piece with a live orchestra (or a digital mockup).</p>

<p>Prices start at $250 per minute (or part of a minute) and depend on specific details such as the requested style(s), instrumentation, delivery requirements, etc&#39; - i.e., do you need a printed score? a mockup? do you expect a fully produced mix? is it an instrumental piece or a song?</p>

<p>This does <em>not</em> include</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m aware that much like music itself, there aren&#39;t any &quot;one size fits all&quot; solutions here and our actual agreement might look different.</p>

<p>Of course, until we reach an actual agreement that we&#39;re both happy with, you will not be able to use any work I may have completed.</p>
